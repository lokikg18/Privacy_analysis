### 🧭 **1. Activity Diagram – Privacy Risk Mitigation Process**

**Overview:**
This activity diagram models the **workflow of privacy risk mitigation** in an IoT-enabled smart city environment. It visually outlines the decision-making and data-handling procedures from the moment data is collected to the point where privacy risks are assessed and addressed.

**Key Activities:**
- **Data Collection:** The process begins with gathering data from IoT devices.
- **Data Type Classification:** Checks whether the data is *personal* or *non-personal*.
- **User Consent Verification:** If the data is personal, the system checks for user consent.
  - If **consent is given**, privacy policies are applied and the data is encrypted.
  - If **not**, the data is anonymized before further processing.
- **Data Storage and Analysis:** The data is stored securely and analyzed for privacy risks.
- **Risk-Based Decision Making:**
  - **High risk:** Alert sent to admin, mitigation strategies applied, and policies updated.
  - **Medium risk:** Risk is logged and a review is scheduled.
  - **Low risk:** Proceed with data use.

**Significance:**
This diagram emphasizes a **privacy-by-design** approach and shows how **user consent, encryption, anonymization, and risk assessment** are integral to protecting citizen data.

### 🔁 **4. Sequence Diagram – Privacy Risk Assessment Workflow**

**Overview:**
This sequence diagram shows a step-by-step interaction flow between actors and system components during a **privacy risk assessment request** from the user.

**Interaction Flow:**

1. 👤 **User** sends a risk assessment request via the `Privacy Dashboard`.
2. 📟 `Dashboard` collects device data from the `IoT Device`.
3. 🧠 It queries the `Privacy Ontology Handler` for relevant rules and data categories.
4. 🧪 Sends the data to the `Privacy Risk Classifier` for risk evaluation.
5. 💾 Results are stored in the `Data Store`.
6. 📊 Dashboard receives and displays the assessment result to the user.

**Significance:**
This diagram highlights the **real-time privacy assessment workflow**, showing how semantic rules and ML models work together to deliver quick and context-aware privacy feedback to users.
